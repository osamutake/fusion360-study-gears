# Gear generation script for Fusion360

[日本語版の説明はこちら](README-ja.md)

This script generates variety of gears in Fusion 360 mainly for studying gears with 3D printers.

Enjoy!

## Features:

* Generation of variety of gears
  * Spur gear
  * Helical gear
  * Internal gear (can be helical)
  * Rack (can be helical)
  * Worm gear & Worm wheel
  * Bevel gear (can be helical)
  * Spiral curve (to create cum and spring)

* Detailed customization of gears
  * Backlash
  * Shift
  * Pressure angle
  * Addendum, Dedendum heights
  * Fillet radius
  * Extrusion of tip of tooths (for hobbing)

This script accurately reproduces the trochoid curve that is generated during the cutting process of gears at the fillet portion of the tooth root. Consequently, it also correctly reflects the undercut that occurs in gears with a small number of teeth, which is impossible with the standard Spur Gear script.

The figure below compare the tooth profiles generated by this script in blue, and by the standard Spur Gear script in yellow-green. The gears generated by the standard Spur Gear script do not rotate correctly when meshed with gears with a large number of teeth due to interference.

# Download & install

Download the  zip file from newest release page and place the `study-gears` folder in the zip file in the `Fusion 360 API Scripts` folder, which is `C:\Users\(user name)\AppData\Roaming\Autodesk\Autodesk Fusion 360\API\Scripts` for Windows environment.

# Basic usage

1. Press `Ctrl+S` in `Design` environment of `Fusion 360` to activate `Scripts and Add-ins` dialog.
2. Select `study-gears` and press `Run` button or just double click `study-gears` to activate the front panel of the script.
3. For the first trial, just press `Ok` button without changing parameters, to find a spur gear generated.<br><br>

# Brief introduction of four tabs

The front panel of the script consists of four tabs, each of which generates different types of gears.

## Cylindrical Tab

Spur, Helical, Internal, and Worm Wheel can be generated on this tab.

- Set `Helix Angle` a non-zero value to generate a Helical gear.
- Check `Internal` checkbox to generated an Internal gear.
  - Set `Outer Diameter` larger than the tip diameter.
- Check `Worm Wheel` checkbox to generate a Worm Wheel.
  - Set `Worm diameter` and `Num. Spiral`.
- Otherwise, a Spur gear is generated.

The images show, in order, helical gears, an internal gear, a worm wheel, and spur gears.

## Rack/Worm Tab

Rack and Worm gears can be generated on this tab.

- Set `Num. Spiral` a non-zero value to generate a Worm gear.
- Otherwise, a Rack gear is generated.

The images show, from left to right, a worm and worm wheel, and a helical rack and pinion.

A pinion is a standard helical gear, while a worm wheel is a specially shaped gear cut to match the worm.

## Bevel Tab

Bevel gears with arbitrary axes angle can be generated on this tab. They can be helical, too.

## Spiral

Spiral curves and cum shapes can be generated on this tab.
