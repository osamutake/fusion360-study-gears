## Features:

* Generation of variety of gears
  * Spur gear
  * Helical gear
  * Internal gear (can be helical)
  * Rack (can be helical)
  * Worm gear & Worm wheel
  * Bevel gear (can be spiral and/or internal)
  * Crown gear (can be helical)
  * Spiral curve (to create cum and spring)

* Detailed customization of gears
  * Backlash
  * Shift
  * Pressure angle
  * Addendum, Dedendum heights
  * Fillet radius
  * Extrusion of tip of tooths (for hobbing)

* Accurate tooth shapes
  * For cylindrical gears, this script accurately reproduces the trochoidal curve that is generated during the cutting process of gears at the fillet portion of the tooth root. Consequently, it also correctly reflects the undercut that occurs in gears with a small number of teeth, which is impossible with the standard Spur Gear script.<br>
  The figure below compare the tooth profiles generated by this script in blue, and by the standard Spur Gear script in yellow-green. The gears generated by the standard Spur Gear script do not rotate correctly when meshed with gears with a large number of teeth due to interference.<br>

  * For worm wheels and crown gears (= face gears), this script actually calculates the cutting process of the gear shapes from a disk-shaped or donut-shaped materials using worm or pinion gear shaped cutting tool with extended tooth tip with fillets. Except for the small error due to the finite number of steps of calculation and approximation with spline curves, it gives the exact shape of the worm wheels and crown gears.
  * For bevel gears, this script generates tooth shapes based on the exact spherical involute curves. It also generates spherical trochoid curve at the root of the tooth. The generated gear shape is not of approximation. It exactly meshes with each other.

# Download & install

Download the zip file from [the newest release](https://github.com/osamutake/fusion360-study-gears/releases) and place the `study-gears` folder in the zip file in the `Fusion 360 API Scripts` folder, which is `C:\Users\(user name)\AppData\Roaming\Autodesk\Autodesk Fusion 360\API\Scripts` for Windows environment.

# Basic usage

1. Press `Ctrl+S` in `Design` environment of `Fusion 360` to activate `Scripts and Add-ins` dialog.<br><br>

# Gear design calculator

A calculator that does calculations for gear design on web browsers is included in this package.

[Gear design calculator](./calc.html)

- Spur&helical gear: Calculate center distance
- Spur&helical gear: Calculate shift from center distance
- Internal gear: calculate center distance
- Internal gear: Calculate shift from center distance
- Bevel Gear

These calculations can be done with the calculator.

# Brief introduction of five tabs

The front panel of the script consists of five tabs, each of which generates different types of gears.

## Cylindrical Tab

Spur, Helical, Internal, and Worm Wheel can be generated on this tab.

- Set `Helix Angle` a non-zero value to generate a Helical gear.
- Check `Internal` checkbox to generated an Internal gear.
  - Set `Outer Diameter` larger than the tip diameter.
- Check `Worm Wheel` checkbox to generate a Worm Wheel.
  - Set `Worm diameter` and `Num. Spiral`.
- Otherwise, a Spur gear is generated.

The images show, in order, helical gears, an internal gear, a worm wheel, and spur gears.

## Rack/Worm Tab

Rack and Worm gears can be generated on this tab.

- Set `Num. Spiral` a non-zero value to generate a Worm gear.
- Otherwise, a Rack gear is generated.

<img src="https://github.com/osamutake/fusion360-study-gears-docs/blob/master/assets/worm+wheel.gif" width="150"/><img src="https://github.com/osamutake/fusion360-study-gears-docs/blob/master/assets/rack.gif" width="150"/>

The images show, from left to right, a worm and worm wheel, and a helical rack and pinion.

A pinion is a standard helical gear, while a worm wheel is a specially shaped gear cut to match the worm.

## Bevel Tab

Bevel gears with arbitrary axes angle can be generated on this tab. They can be spiral and/or internal, too.

## Crown Tab

Crown gears, which is also known as face gears, can be generated on this tab.
